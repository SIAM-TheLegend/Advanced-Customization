# Implementation Flow

The `docs/implementation-overview.md` file should be fomatted in this way (Create it if it doesn't exists):

```markdown
## Already Implemented

- Already Implemented things and their details
- (Your implementations details should be added here)

## Next Steps

- Recommended Next steps
- (According to the project, add the recommended potential next steps here)

## Issues

- Issue name: Issue details
- (If you notice any issue in this project, mention it here)
```

Always check the already implemented things from the `docs/implementation-overview.md` file before every response, so that you can have a great idea about what's going on in this project.

After every response, add a note/checkpoint on the `docs/implementation-overview.md` file on the above format, so that I can get idea of the project from that file on future.
